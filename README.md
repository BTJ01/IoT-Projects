# Pi-Projects

A place to keep track of things used in my Raspberry Pi Projects

## Projects

#### 1. Pi-Hole
Pi Zero W + PiTFT:

* Stats.py - tweaked script from AdaFruit to adjust stats display to my liking
  - changed to display "Pi-Hole" as first line
  - changed font colors
  - removed "IP" & "DNS Queries" from second screen 
  - added "CPU Temp" to second screen
  - changed "Mem:" to "Memory:" and moved values to new line to avoid off screen text
