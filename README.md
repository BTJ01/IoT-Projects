# Pi-Projects

A place to keep track of things used in my Raspberry Pi Projects

## Projects

#### 1. Pi-Hole
Pi Zero W + PiTFT:

* Stats.py - tweaked script from AdaFruit ([found here](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-hole-ad-blocker-with-pi-zero-w/install-mini-pitft "Pi-Hole Ad-Blocker: Install Mini PiTFT")) to adjust stats display to my liking
  - changed `HOST` to display "Pi-Hole", moved to first line
  - changed font colors
  - removed `IP` & `DNS Queries` from second screen 
  - added `CPU Temp` to second screen
  - changed `Mem:` to `Memory:` and moved values to new line to fix off screen text
